## Recommendations

<br/>

### Age

Create content that is focused on audiences between **25 to 35 years old**. This age range provides more than 40% of the people who interact with Fox Pest Control.

### Mobile device

Prioritize content for **mobile devices**. 64% of our audience interacts with our websites through mobile devices.  


### Gender

Although more than 60% of our overall audience are **females** it is recommended to create content for both genders because in most of the branches the percent of females and males are relatively comparable.

### Interest

The top 2 interests of the population who search for pest control are **Home & Garden/Home Decor** and **Real Estate/Residential Properties**. The most popular reason is because most people want to either protect or sell their homes. 
It is recommended to advertise Fox Pest Control in real estate and home improvement retail websites. 

### Content in Spanish 

Create Content in **Spanish**. 23% of the leads received in 2022 come from Texas. Around 85% of the population in Texas speak Spanish and 40% are Hispanic or Latino. According to the U.S. Census in 2021, around 15% of the population in Texas did not speak English well and more than a third of the population feel more comfortable speaking a language other than English. Additionally, NY and IL are listed on the top 5 states where Spanish is spoken. 22% of the leads we obtained in 2022 are from these two states.
